So first in server.js we imported express, mongoose, helmet and cors

Then we created our server

We created our database schema in friendsSchema.js

We then import our schema into our routes file, or friendController.js

Now in our routes file we do something very different, we establish our routes and then 
just add our methods to them.

Seems more efficient and easier to read this way.
