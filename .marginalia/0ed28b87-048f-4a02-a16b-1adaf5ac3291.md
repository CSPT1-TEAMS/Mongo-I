When the client makes a `GET` request to `/api/friends`:

* If there's an error retrieving the _friends_ from the database:
  * cancel the request.
  * respond with HTTP status code `500`.
  * return the following JSON object: `{ errorMessage: "The friends information could not be retrieved." }`.

- On success return status code `200` (OK) and the list of all friends contained in the friends collection.
